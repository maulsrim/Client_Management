The .feature files written in Gherkin describe the expected behavior of the application under BDD methodology.
Each scenario outlines user interactions such as client creation and meeting scheduling.
These scripts serve as behavior specifications for the app and can be executed later using tools like Cucumber.js or Behave for automated testing.
